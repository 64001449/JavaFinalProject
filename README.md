# learningJava2022
  Our goals was to make an app that was similar to Akinator. The Akinator game on the internet uses yes - or - no type of questions to guess a particular character that the user should keep in mind, such as a TV character and such. We replicated that game in Java, but for all the people in our Java right now. In order to maximize our learning from this project, we decided to use objects. Here, we first decided to create an object class called FinalProjectObject, and from there we created an ArrayList of FinalProjectObject Objects in another class called MainFrame, which we named finalp. Each Person Object consists of an takes in an eye, hair, height, and glasses string parameter. Then, we asked our entire Java class to fill out our survey to fill up a spreadsheet with everyone in the classroom for all the characteristics that we needed. Then, we created separate text files with all the physical characteristics of each person. Next, we made each text file into an ArrayList using the importFile method from the coding challenges Replits. We then added all of these characteristics to make up each FinalProjectObject object, and then we added that to finalp. Then, we implemented a series of while loops and methods to randomly choose a question category (Eye question, Hair question, etc.), to which the user would have to answer yes or no. After the user answered, the program would remove everyone in the ArrayList that didn’t apply to the user’s answer (Eg. If the user answered “no” to the question that asked him ”Do you have blue eyes”, then the program would remove eve). This process would continue until the program narrows down the ArrayList to 1 person, which it would then display their name. Additionally, we also made a new addition to our program where the user can be the Akinator. Here, a person is randomly chosen from the ArrayList finalp, and their characteristics were displayed. From there, the player needed to effectively guess who the person was in the Java class.
  The biggest new learning that we took away from this project was effectively learning how to convert our code into the GUI Swing software. Here, due to our slight time-wasting throughout the weeks, we needed to effectively convert all of our code to GUI in the last 4 or 5 days of the project. However, because we each put 1 to 2 hours everyday after school to get on calls and work together on it, we were able to finish it. An example of our GUI was the yes button software. Firstly, the ActionListener method is used in order to account for the action of clicking the yes button. From there, we first removed the type of question (eye color, hair color, height, or glasses) that was just asked from our total type of characteristics ArrayList, better known as options. Then, if this type was glasses, it removed all people in the finalp ArrayList that had glasses, else if it was not, it removed all the people in finalp that had the characteristic of real2. Going forward, if the finalp size was 1, it ended the random program going on. Else, if the finalp size was 2 and the options size is 0, meaning that there are 2 people with the same stats, it asks a different, differentiating question. Else, it asks the next random question.
